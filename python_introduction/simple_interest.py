# Define the variables for the simple interest calculation
# P = Principal amount (initial investment)
principal = 1000

# R = Annual interest rate (as a decimal)
rate = 0.05

# T = Time the money is invested for in years
time = 3

# Calculate the simple interest using the formula: I = P * R * T
interest = principal * rate * time

# Print the calculated interest in the specified format
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")

# Expected Output:
# The simple interest is: 150.0
