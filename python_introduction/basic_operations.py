# Define the two required numbers
number1 = 10
number2 = 5

# Perform the arithmetic operations
sum_result = number1 + number2
difference_result = number1 - number2
product_result = number1 * number2

# Print the results in the specified human-readable format

# 1. Addition
print(f"Addition of {number1} and {number2} is {sum_result}")

# 2. Subtraction
print(f"Subtraction of {number1} and {number2} is {difference_result}")

# 3. Multiplication
print(f"Multiplication of {number1} and {number2} is {product_result}")

# Expected Output:
# Addition of 10 and 5 is 15
# Subtraction of 10 and 5 is 5
# Multiplication of 10 and 5 is 50
